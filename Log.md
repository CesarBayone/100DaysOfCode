#100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 4th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: Second attempt to this challenge. Finishing up a forum app built in my own PHP MVC. 

**Thoughts:** Everything went smooth today, hope this continues to be this way in the upcoming days. 

### Days 2-3: February 5th -6th, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I finished my forum app with all the CRUD funcionality. Will be uploading the code to github in a bit.

**Thoughts:** Haven't been able to code really well these days because internet connection problems. I'm proud of myself for not letting the challenge die because of this.
